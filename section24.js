/* getElementById Practice
Let's get some practice using getElementById. I've provided a little bit of markup for you 
(please don't change it!)  Your goal is to write code in app.js to select the following 
elements using getElementById:

Select the image element by its id and save it to a variable called image

Select the h1 by its id and save it to a variable called heading

Note: You may need to reset the code before attempting this exercise 

Project HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Unicorn</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="mainheading">I &hearts; unicorns</h1>
    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1550747528-cdb45925b3f7?w=200" id="unicorn" alt="unicorn">
    <!-- image source: unsplash.com -->
</body>
</html>

*/
// project JS:

const image = document.getElementById("unicorn");

const heading = document.getElementById("mainheading");
